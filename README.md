This is a project where I am developing a game in 2d with pseudo random terrain generation.
There are a few aspects of game development that are giving me the perfect excuse to further my knowledge and understanding of java as a programming language and application design.

This particular repo is essentially 'paused' as development of this game has moved towards system design to enable rapid prototyping of new ideas.
